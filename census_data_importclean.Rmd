### 1. Working with YH population data
Download Yorkshire & Humber LSOA population data from the [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/censusoutputareaestimatesintheyorkshireandthehumberregionofengland ) I chose mid-2015 for now

### 2. Add up the total population for each LSOA
The ONS data is categorised on LSOA11 and OA11 which means that there are several rows for each LSOA which need to be added together.
``` {r}
censuswhole2015 <- read_excel("mid2015census.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Mid-2015 Persons", skip = 4)
censuswhole2015 <- censuswhole2015 %>% rename(lsoa11 = LSOA11CD) %>% rename(totpop = "All Ages") 
censuswhole2015 = subset (censuswhole2015, select = c( "lsoa11", "totpop"))
censuswhole2015 <- censuswhole2015 %>% group_by (lsoa11) %>% summarise_all(funs(sum))

```
