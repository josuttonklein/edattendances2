This is the code that I am using to explore spatial variability in emergency department attendances.

<!--- Set working directory --->
```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE }
setwd("D:/DEPED/Github/edattendances2/")
```

<!--- Setting up R studio for the analysis --->
```{r, child = "Setting_up_Rstudio.Rmd", echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

```


The first stage is importing and cleaning the health data. In this section I also calculate the proportion of low acuity attendances for each locality

```{r, child = "HES_data_importclean.Rmd", echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

```
